1. load only the peras which are on screen
2. merge mode
3. Storylines sessions
4. manual backups

I want a change to the core system. 
Now the hierarchy will be:
Storyline -> Sessions -> Peragraphs

Note: there is already data exist on localstorage,
migrate gracefully

I may:
1. also reorder sessions
2. On each sessions 
    a) show the ending (the heading of next sessions first pera)
    b) show the Starting (the heading of prev sessions last pera)

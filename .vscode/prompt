the textarea of the peras has auto height adjusting based on writing feature that is very helpful
but one problem with it is when on a mobile device  



i want a way to make read only any stories from the root (where all storylines listed)
1. dont persist it to cloud, its only for device to device
2. just store it to ls `storyline_app_meta` key. 
3. when marked as readonly, never ever make any change or save.
 just show in preview mode

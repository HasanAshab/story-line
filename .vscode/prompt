The peras has so many buttons on it so that its making it harder to focus on writing,
thats why add a 3 dot dropdown menu on each pera. and pack these button inside it
1. move to top
2. move to bottom
3. complete with ai
4. add/edit notes
5. delete




i want a way to make read only any stories from the root (where all storylines listed)
1. dont persist it to cloud, its only for device to device
2. just store it to ls `storyline_app_meta` key. 
3. when marked as readonly, never ever make any change or save.
 just show in preview mode
